UglyMol is a web-based macromolecular viewer focused on electron density.

It makes models and e.den. maps easy to recognize, navigate and interpret --
for [Coot](http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/personal/pemsley/coot/) users.
It looks like coot and walks (mouse controls) like coot.
Except when it doesn't -- see the
[FAQ](https://github.com/uglymol/uglymol/wiki).

It's only a viewer. For situations when you want
a quick look without downloading the data and starting Coot.
For instance, when screening
[Dimple](http://ccp4.github.io/dimple/) results in a synchrotron.
Of course, for this to work, it needs to be integrated into a website
that provides the data access
(see the [FAQ](https://github.com/uglymol/uglymol/wiki) on how to do it).

But first try it:

- [1MRU](1mru.html) (60kDa, 3Å),
  and in [dual view](dual.html) with PDB_REDO,
- a bigger one -- [4UN4](4un4.html) (200kDa, 2.4Å),
- [a blob](dimple_thaum.html#xyz=14,18,12&eye=80,71,-41&zoom=70)
  (Dimple result, thaumatin, 1.4Å).

UglyMol is a small (~3 KLOC) [project](https://github.com/uglymol/uglymol)
forked from Nat Echols' [xtal.js](https://github.com/natechols/xtal.js/).
The [plan](https://github.com/uglymol/uglymol/blob/master/TODO.md)
is to keep it small. But if you're missing some functionality,
it won't hurt if you get in touch --
use [Issues](https://github.com/uglymol/uglymol/issues)
or [chat](https://gitter.im/ccp4/dimple)
or email wojdyr@gmail.com.

Finally, if you need pretty visualization,
or if you trust the model and don't need to see the electron density,
use one of many
[other viewers](https://github.com/uglymol/uglymol/wiki/MolecularViewers).
